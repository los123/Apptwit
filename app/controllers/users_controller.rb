before_filter :authenticate, :only => [:index,:edit, :update]
# before filter arranges for a particular method to be called before t
# he given actions.
# In this case, we define an authenticate method and invoke it using 
# before_filter :authenticate. (See authenticate method in private section)
# By default, before filters apply to every action in a controller, so here 
# we restrict the filter to act only on the :edit and :update actions by passing 
# the :only options hash.
before_filter :correct_user, :only => [:edit, :update]
# See correct_user method defines in private section

before_filter :admin_user,   :only => :destroy
# A before filter restricting the destroy action to admins.

# We can paginate the users in the sample application by using paginate in 
# place of all in the index action (Listing 10.28). Here

# User.paginate pulls the users out of the database one chunk at a time 
# (30 by default), based on the :page parameter.
# :page parameter comes from params[:page], which is generated automatically
